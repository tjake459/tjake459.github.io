# Professional Self-Assessment
Over the past few years I have grown from a bootcamp student learning Java, POJOs, and DynamoDB setup, into a computer science graduate from Southern New Hampshire University with practical, portfolio-ready experience. Building my ePortfolio helped me showcase strengths I can bring to a team right away. I turned coursework into working software, documented decisions, and published everything on GitHub and GitHub Pages so employers can quickly verify my skills. These experiences shaped my goals and values around writing clear, maintainable code, validating requirements with stakeholders, and delivering secure, reliable systems that are easy to extend.
My capstone ties together full-stack web and mobile development. I implemented a backend using Node and Express, a frontend using JavaScript, HTML, and Handlebars, and a single MongoDB/Mongoose database for users and events that powers both web and Android. I applied security measures directly in the application by using password hash/salt and JWT for authentication, reflecting my commitment to building production-minded features. Earlier work in CS 305 Software Security strengthened this mindset: I ran OWASP Dependency-Check (Maven), separated false positives from real risks, proposed mitigation strategies, and produced clear security documentation and vulnerability reports. Together these efforts show I can both build features and protect them.
Across the program I practiced the core skills employers expect. In team settings I collaborated through code reviews that made my reasoning visible and helpful to others. In communicating with stakeholders, I translated requirements into simple, annotated wireframes and then into system designs. For data structures and algorithms, I modeled users and events, designed DTOs for clean API boundaries, and implemented practical sorting strategies (by importance and event date) to serve real use cases. In software engineering and databases, I designed a single, consistent data model and exposed it through an API that my mobile client consumes. In security I implemented hash/salt for passwords and JWT to maintain authenticated sessions across the app, and I validated dependencies with OWASP tooling.
The artifacts in my portfolio fit together as one story: CS-255 System Design (requirements, use cases, diagrams) → CS-250 SDLC (process fundamentals) → CS-300 DSA Analysis & Design (data structures/algorithms used later for models, DTOs, and sorting) → CS-340 Client/Server Development and CS-360 Mobile Architecture/Programming (full-stack and mobile patterns) → CS-320 Software Testing (test planning and automation) → CS-305 Software Security and CS-405 Secure Coding (OWASP dependency checks, mitigation strategies, hash/salt, JWT). The capstone ties these together into a working product with a Node/Express backend, JavaScript/HTML/HBS frontend, a single MongoDB/Mongoose database shared with Android, and security baked in. Taken as a whole, the artifacts demonstrate that I can move from stakeholder requirements and system design through implementation, security, and testing, end to end relevant pieces, full-stack development, security analysis, or system design, while still showing the complete picture of my capabilities.
Overall, this portfolio introduces me as a developer who can read requirements, communicate clearly, design systems, implement features end-to-end, and secure what I build. It reflects my growth through the program and my readiness to contribute on day one.
