# Artifact 1 — Mobile Event Tracker (CS 360) Pre-Updates

## Artifact Description
The artifact I selected is my **mobile event tracker application** from **CS 360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming)**. It was originally created in **Android Studio** using **Java** and **XML**. The app lets a user sign up or log in, choose **SMS notification permission**, and then view an event page where events can be added, updated, or deleted. The application uses two **SQLite databases**: one for users and one for events.

## Why I Selected This Artifact
I chose this artifact because it was a solid starting point but not fully complete, which made it a good candidate for enhancements. It already showed my ability to design and build working applications, but by improving it, I can also show that I can **refactor and restructure code**, **apply best practices**, and **prepare an application for modern deployment**.
