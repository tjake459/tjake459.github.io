# Artifact 1 — Mobile Event Tracker (CS 360) Pre-Updates

## Artifact Description
The artifact I selected is my mobile event tracker application from CS 360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming). It was originally created in Android Studio using Java and XML. The app lets a user sign up or log in, choose SMS notification permission, and then view an event page where events can be added, updated, or deleted. The application uses two SQLite databases: one for users and one for events. 

## Why I Selected This Artifact
I chose this artifact because it was a solid starting point but not fully complete, which made it a good candidate for enhancements. It already showed my ability to design and build working applications, but by improving it, I can also show that I can refactor and restructure code, apply best practices, and prepare an application for modern deployment.
