# Artifact 2 — Software Design and Engineering Updates

## Artifact Description
This artifact is the same event tracking app that was created in android studio, but re-created in visual studio code as a web application.It utilizes js and node.js, express, using a MVC approac with HBS and JSON

## Enhancements / Improvements
•	Modern development: I recreated the app in Visual Studio Code as a Node.js/Express project using MVC architecture with Handlebars templates. This shows proper separation of concerns and aligns with industry best practices.
•	Preparation for future work: I scaffolded the project for MongoDB integration, which will be addressed more fully in the Databases milestone.

## Learning & Reflection
Through this enhancement, I gained more experience with JavaScript, Express, and Handlebars, which expanded my skill set beyond Android development. I learned how to set up MVC folder structures, manage routes and controllers, and prepare a project for database migration.
One challenge I faced was when creating the main folders for the Node.js app. At first, I was unsure of the correct commands to scaffold the structure, but by practicing with the terminal and using Express Generator, I learned how to build the setup properly. This gave me more confidence in working across both Java and JavaScript ecosystems.
